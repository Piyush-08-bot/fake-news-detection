## Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end fake-news classification workflow. It combines a complete training notebook with a polished Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.

- **Dataset**: ISOT Fake News Dataset (~38,646 articles)
- **Model**: TF-IDF Vectorization + Logistic Regression
- **UI**: Streamlit dashboard with visual analytics

## Features

- **Real-time analysis** from pasted text or a URL
- **Confidence and probability** visualizations
- **Classifier deep-dive** with ROC, confusion matrix, and feature importance
- **NLP insights** into top vocabulary patterns
- **Interactive training** notebook

## Tech Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.x
- **ML/NLP**: scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, numpy
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **UI Components**: streamlit-shadcn-ui

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piyush-08-bot/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Install Jupyter for training and exploration:

```bash
python3 -m pip install ipykernel jupyter
```

## Usage

### Run the Dashboard

```bash
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

### Training and Exploration

```bash
jupyter notebook News_Credibility_Training.ipynb
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit dashboard
- `News_Credibility_Training.ipynb` — model training pipeline
- `utils.py` — text preprocessing utilities
- `models/` — serialized model and vectorizer
- `data/` — dataset storage (not tracked in git)

## Notes

- URL extraction uses `newspaper3k`. Some sites block scraping or return insufficient text.
- This classifier detects linguistic patterns and does not verify factual truth. Use it as a signal, not a final verdict.
